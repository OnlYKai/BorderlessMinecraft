# [BorderlessMinecraft](https://github.com/OnlYKai/BorderlessMinecraft/releases/latest/download/BorderlessMinecraft.exe)
**This is a Tray Only Application, settings can be accessed by right-clicking the tray icon!**
* Pressing F11 while in Minecraft will toggle Borderless Window / Windowed Fullscreen instead of regular Fullscreen
* Enable 'Autoborderless' to automatically make Minecraft borderless on startup (just like normal fullscreen does)

# !!! IMPORTANT !!!

**Note: This is all from testing on <ins>MY</ins> system, it might be different for you, and I don't know if I will fix problems that don't affect me. After all, I created this for my personal use and fun!**

## Disable fullscreen in the Minecraft ingame settings
**Make sure to disable it in the settings, if you use F11 it may not save it (at least in oder Minecraft versions that's the case)**

If Minecraft is in regular fullscreen mode:
* F11 will work as normal and thus exit fullscreen
* Autoborderless won't work, you'll have to manually exit fullscreen and press F11 again to enter borderless mode

That is, if it actually detects Minecraft being in fullscreen mode. (Works on my system, but might not work on yours!)\
Otherwise it will probably do nothing, but act scuffed until you restart your game.

## Needs **<ins>SAME</ins>** privileges as Minecraft
If Minecraft starts without admin privileges (default behaviour), **<ins>DO NOT</ins>** give this software admin privileges, it won't work!\
If you do start Minecraft with admin privileges, this software needs them too! In that case autostart won't work.*

*You can use Task Scheduler if you need to autostart a program with admin privileges, check 'Run with highest privileges' and choose 'At log on' as trigger.
